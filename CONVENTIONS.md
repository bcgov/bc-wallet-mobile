## UI Feedback: Use Banner Messages, Not Toast Notifications

Use banner messages (inline, persistent contextual alerts) instead of toast notifications for user feedback.

**Why:** Banners are more accessible, remain visible until dismissed, and fit better within screen flows than transient toasts which can be missed or obscure content.

## UI Interaction: Allow users to access screens before async resources are ready

Where possible, users should be able to access screens or tools before async resources
(e.g. wallet initialization) are ready. Rather than blocking navigation, show a banner
message or text on the screen itself informing the user that the feature isn't available yet and to try again shortly.
