# Update Indy Ledgers Strategy
#
# This workflow has two modes:
#
# 1. PR Check (automatic):
#    - Runs on every pull request
#    - Checks if ledgers.json is outdated by comparing against upstream sources
#    - PASSES if ledgers are up-to-date
#    - FAILS if ledgers need updating (blocks PR merge until fixed)
#
# 2. Manual Update (workflow_dispatch):
#    - Triggered manually from GitHub Actions UI
#    - Allows you to specify a branch name to update
#    - Fetches latest ledgers and commits them to the specified branch
#
